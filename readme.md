This is URL Shortener using multiple AWS Services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway).

You can find a working version here: [https://cwoellner.com/urlshortener/](https://cwoellner.com/urlshortener/)

TODOs:

Cloudfront:
  - Add CORS for API Gateway
  - Dynamicly get bucket name
  - Set up a lifecycle policy for the S3 Bucket
  - Find a way to upload the lambda code within the template
The live version has these issues fixed via manual intervention.
